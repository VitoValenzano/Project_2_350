# About 
Ignite is a piece of software that is deigned to be run on several servers that interconnect to form a network of databases.
## Usage 
Apache Ignite is designed to be deployed as a distributed in-memory computing platform. It can be installed on various operating systems, including Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It is able to interface with several programming languages, such as 
- Java
- SQL
- REST API
- C#/.NET
- C++
- Python
- Node.JS
- PHP

It also has several APIs that are accessible for various languages.

Ignite is designed to be run across a fleet of servers, but it can be run on a single machine for testing. It is designed to be run entirely in memory, with no disk presence for the stored data.

Ignite can be used with SQL as well, as it can be accessed via JDBC and OBDC drivers.

Ignite would be ideal for systems that deal with Data that isn't being stored long-term One of the main shortcomings of Ignite is that is you face an issue like power failure, you could experience severe data loss. Storing sensitive, long-term data on Ignite could be a *very* poor idea.
## History
Ignite was initially developed as a closed source, commercial software by GridGain systems. In 2014, They donated the software as open source. It was taken into the Apache Incubator program, and then graduated to a top-level Apache program in 2015. GridGain is still the top contributor.
## Future
Ignite's last stable release was in December of 2023, with the current version number being 2.16. There is currently an eastly alpha release of 3.0.0, but the last alpha released in June of 2022.
